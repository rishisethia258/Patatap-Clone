#Patatap Clone
This is a clone of a famous website [patatap](https://patatap.com).

This site was built using paperjs (for animations) and howlerjs (for sounds).

Normally opening the circles.html file in your browser may run perfectly fine, but in console it gives errors regarding Cross origins.

To get rid of these errors you can run the following commands in your terminal.

* If you have python v2.x installed :

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

* If you have python v3.x installed :

`python -m http.server`


After this you may open the following link in your browser :

`http://localhost:8000/circles.html`
